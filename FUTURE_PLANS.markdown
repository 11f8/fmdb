# THESE ARE THE PLANS FOR FMDB 3.0.
Nothing is set in stone, but these are the things that would be awesome.

* Have some official swift bindings
* use a queue for multiple readers, but single writers
* Fix the compiler issues that Peter brought up: https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en_US#!topic/fmdb/LAIFZm-GLOg
* Async versions of update methods.
* Killing executeUpdateWithFormat: , since it's prone to error
*
